# Starbound-Mod
How do I install the mod? This mod requires a mod to work. Funny, right? First, head over to the releases page and download "Alpaca.zip" and "xbawks.zip". You could clone the repo if you also desire.

Extract Files (I am not going to tell you how to do this, figure it out.)

Move the folders into the "mods" folder. (My Starbound directory is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\mods, yours might be different.)

To find your folder go to Starbound on Steam, click on the cog icon, hover over mange, then click browse local files.

Move the two mods into the folder.

Launch Starbound.
